AICTE Internship Project - Predicting Greenhouse Gas Emissions using Machine Learning and Data Science.


# 🌿 Greenhouse Gas Emissions Prediction
**AICTE Internship Project – June 2025**  

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to predict Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions based on historical data of U.S. commodities and industries using machine learning techniques. Developed as part of the **AICTE Internship 2025**, the goal is to leverage data analytics to model environmental impacts and support climate-conscious decision-making.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Greenhouse gases significantly affect climate change, and industries are major contributors. The objective of this project is to:

- **Analyze** GHG emission patterns from 2010 to 2016 across U.S. supply chains.
- **Predict** future emissions using machine learning models.
- **Identify** key factors contributing to high emissions in both commodity and industry sectors.

---

## 📚 Dataset

- **Name:** Supply Chain GHG Emission Factors for US Commodities and Industries  
- **Format:** Excel spreadsheet with multiple sheets (2010–2016)
- **Sheets:** 
  - `2010_Detail_Commodity`
  - `2010_Detail_Industry`
  - ... up to 2016

Each sheet contains GHG emission factors for different economic activities in CO₂ equivalent metrics.

## 💻 Technologies & Libraries Used

- **Language:** Python 3.x  
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook  
- **Libraries:**
  - `pandas` – data manipulation
  - `numpy` – numerical operations
  - `matplotlib` & `seaborn` – data visualization
  - `scikit-learn` – machine learning
  - `joblib` – model serialization

---

## ⚙️ Machine Learning Workflow

1. **Data Loading & Merging**
   - Load yearly Excel sheets
   - Merge relevant columns and standardize formats

2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handle missing values
   - Drop irrelevant or redundant columns

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Encode categorical variables
   - Normalize numerical data

4. **Model Training**
   - Split data into training and testing sets
   - Train a **Random Forest Regressor**
   - Perform hyperparameter tuning using `GridSearchCV`

5. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluate using:
     - R² Score
     - RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
     - MAE (Mean Absolute Error)

6. **Model Saving**
   - Save the final model using `joblib` for deployment or reuse
